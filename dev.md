#### Yara Developer

To apply to yara developers just send a POST request to https://api.yara.moe/dev/
with the following JSON data:

```json
{
"userid":"UserID as a STRING",
"name":"DiscordName#Tag",
"applyingTo":"well dev duh",
"reason":"a reason why we should accept you and trust you",
"showcase":"a link to a pastebin with more links of your work, thanks!",
"disclaimer":"I agree"
}
```

The disclaimer is displayed on the home of the [Yara info page](README.md)

also note you have to have a header in your request named "APPLY" with the contents `"weebLife"`

if you dont give proper info/invalid headers then you'll get some sweet replies.

if your application is accepted (by the server) then you'll get a sweet response!
and we'll DM you back with your test results ^-^


Well, thats that!
